# MES Inhibitor Config
This Space Engineers plugin allows you to disable the inhibitors for any encounters done through [Modular Encounters Systems](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1521905890). All inhibitors are disabled by default, so if you wish to change which inhibitors are disabled, you can use the config file in the world's "Storage" folder.
  
If requested I will develop a version for use on servers, but this only works in singleplayer.
